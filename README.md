**Optimised simulator engine for NEURON**

CoreNEURON is a compute engine for the NEURON simulator optimised for both memory usage and computational speed. Its goal is to simulate large cell networks with small memory footprint and optimal performance.

**Blue Brain Simulation and Neural network Analysis Productivity layer (Blue Brain SNAP)**

Blue Brain SNAP is a Python library for accessing BlueBrain circuit models represented in SONATA format.

**Visualizer for large-scale and interactive ray-tracing of neurons**

Brayns is a minimalistic visualiser that can perform ray-traced rendering of neurons. It provides an abstraction of the underlying rendering engines, so that the best possible acceleration libraries can be used for the relevant hardware.
